My teaching strategies include 

-Providing
children with ample provocation such as learning materials with self-check and
learning corners for children to explore and learn independently or with their
peers.

-Providing
opportunities for children to collaborate with their peers as a form of social
interaction in class. This allows children to learn from one another and
advance their zone of proximal development where the more skilled peer teaches
the child and then is ultimately able to complete the task on his/her own.

-Using
positive reinforcement to encourage more positive behaviours in class rather
than using authoritative approach so that children will enjoy and fully
participate in lessons and activities without feeling fearful.
